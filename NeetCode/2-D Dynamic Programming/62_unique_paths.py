62. Unique Paths

There is a robot on an m x n grid.
The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]).
The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]).
The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers m and n, 
return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach
the bottom-right corner.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal
to 2 * 10^9.

Example:
    Input: m = 3, n = 7
    Output: 28
